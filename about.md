Hi,
I'm Marco, I live near Vercelli, and I'm a tehcnology enthusiast.

I have a background in electronics, system administration, databases and development and I'm currently working privately as an IT consultant.

I'm contributing to Mozilla's mission for the Web, as a senior software engineer in the Firefox Desktop Team. More specifically I'm the owner of the Storage and Places modules, and a peer of Browser and Toolkit.

This blog is intended to serve anything that passionates me: development, Mozilla news and technology in general, but also life facts.

You can contact me at **blog** AT **bonardo** DOT **net**.
